# Open CaptchaWorld Dataset

This dataset accompanies the paper [Open CaptchaWorld: A Comprehensive Web-based Platform for Testing and Benchmarking Multimodal LLM Agents](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.24878). It contains 20 distinct CAPTCHA types, each testing different visual reasoning capabilities. The dataset is designed for evaluating the visual reasoning and interaction capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-powered agents.

The dataset includes:

*   **20 CAPTCHA Types**: A diverse set of visual puzzles testing various capabilities. See the Github repository for a full list.
*   **Web Interface**: A clean, intuitive interface for human or AI interaction.
*   **API Endpoints**: Programmatic access to puzzles and verification.

This dataset is useful for benchmarking and improving multimodal AI agents' performance on CAPTCHA-like challenges, a crucial step in deploying web agents for real-world tasks. The data is structured for easy integration into research and development pipelines.
